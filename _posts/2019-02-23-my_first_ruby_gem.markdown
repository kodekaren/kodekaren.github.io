I got around to writing the cpde for my first Ruby project and I was scared.
I was dreading the time my project would begin and at the same time I just wanted to get it done, learn and go ahead with my coding bootcamp.
As I mentioned in my previous blog post, I decided to take it easy and to slow down my pace to learn and absorb more of the information as I go along.

The beginning:

I had to think about my gem, to make decisions while moving in an unknown territory. Simply choosing the website to scrape was a challenge and I found myself browsing options and thinking hard about my project, only to resort to a website that means something to me, that I like and that Ii know well: Elephant Journal.
Once that decision was made, I had to start.
I watched the tutorials and had to re-do my Git repository about 6 times. I changed the name and kept on panicking about breaking my not-even-there program.
**Pro tip: When you create your repository, only use underscores instead of dashes <3**

The code:

Tutorials were my go-to for writing code. I had a hard time figuring out what to do after I started coding and Avi Flombaum's [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lDExWIhYKI) was a life-saver. 
His approach to problem solving is so helpful and it teaches you how to figure things out using the same pattern of thought. 
Slowly the code came together and I surprised myself by slowly trying to debug without tests. Tests are so helpful and I definitely plan on writing them for my next projects. Once you start cpding without tests, you can see just how useful TDD can be!

What my gem does:

My gem -perfect word to describe my little new creation- scrapes Elephant Journal, my favorite blog. It tells you the top 3 blog posts of the day and allows the user to read them. 

My dpubt is mainly regarding how useful my gem can possibly be and, although this may not be my masterpiece, it is the result of lots of hard work and I will always respect it as such. You should do the same with your own projects :)


**Happy Coding Everyone*!***
