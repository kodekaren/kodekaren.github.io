Coding is no easy feat. I'm a novice and, as many out there, I embarked on this journey in the hopes of learning a lot and changing something in my life.

A month in, I was stuck and it seems like something all too common among people out there, learning by themselves.

Today I want to share how I got unstuck and what moved me further in my program.

**I went back**
At some point in the Object Oriented Ruby secttion of my bootcamp program, I missed a couple of things. 
"It's normal" i thought, "I'll understand everything further ahead, this is like a puzzle".
It is indeed like a ouzzle but it's also very important not to misss pieces of information since everything builds on top pd everything else. I went back, studied again, took my time and read theough all the studf once more.

**I took some time off**
This worked for me. I like to bulldoze through thungs and I always have considered myself a quick learner. A month in I was tired of keeping my life together and straining myself with a heavy bootcamp. I ewlazed more and things started to come natural. I would be on the train ans think of the way to solve a lab, incredible...and fun. Tajing some time off made me realize i like coding.

I hope my experience can help you too :)
