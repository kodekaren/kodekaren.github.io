I'm a traveler, a woman and a single mom. 
I never questioned wether I'm part of some kind of minority but, all I can say is that it's not always easy.

What I wrote above os not all that defines me, either. I'm creative and driven by DIY, budgeting and all things smart - and by smart I'm really talking about stuff that can help me save time-.

I work as a coach for high level professionals seeking to improve their soft skills in english but am looking tp transition to something that can help me spend more time with my kids and help them grow in what feels more like a family.

I'm one of those people who never give up so folow me along and see where I get to :)
